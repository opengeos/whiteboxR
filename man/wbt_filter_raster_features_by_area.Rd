\item{background}{Background value.}

\item{wd}{Changes the working directory.}

\item{verbose_mode}{Sets verbose mode. If verbose mode is \code{FALSE}, tools will not print output messages.}

\item{compress_rasters}{Sets the flag used by WhiteboxTools to determine whether to use compression for output rasters.}

\item{command_only}{Return command that would be executed by \code{system()} rather than running tool.}

\value{
Returns the tool text outputs.
