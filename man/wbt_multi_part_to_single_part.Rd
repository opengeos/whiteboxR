\item{exclude_holes}{Exclude hole parts from the feature splitting? (holes will continue to belong to their features in output.).}

\item{wd}{Changes the working directory.}

\item{verbose_mode}{Sets verbose mode. If verbose mode is \code{FALSE}, tools will not print output messages.}

\item{compress_rasters}{Sets the flag used by 'WhiteboxTools' to determine whether to use compression for output rasters.}

\item{command_only}{Return command that would be executed by \code{system()} rather than running tool.}

\value{
Returns the tool text outputs.
