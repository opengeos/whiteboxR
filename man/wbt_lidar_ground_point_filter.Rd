}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Input LiDAR file.}

\item{output}{Output LiDAR file.}

\item{radius}{Search Radius.}

\item{min_neighbours}{The minimum number of neighbouring points within search areas. If fewer points than this threshold are idenfied during the fixed-radius search, a subsequent kNN search is performed to identify the k number of neighbours.}

\item{slope_threshold}{Maximum inter-point slope to be considered an off-terrain point.}

\item{height_threshold}{Inter-point height difference to be considered an off-terrain point.}

\item{classify}{Classify points as ground (2) or off-ground (1).}

\item{slope_norm}{Perform initial ground slope normalization?.}

\item{height_above_ground}{Transform output to height above average ground elevation?.}

\item{wd}{Changes the working directory.}

\item{verbose_mode}{Sets verbose mode. If verbose mode is False, tools will not print output messages.}

\item{compress_rasters}{Sets the flag used by WhiteboxTools to determine whether to use compression for output rasters.}
}
\value{
Returns the tool text outputs.
