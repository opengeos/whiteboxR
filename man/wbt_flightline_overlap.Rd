\arguments{
\item{input}{Input LiDAR file.}

\item{output}{Output file.}

\item{resolution}{Output raster's grid resolution.}

\item{wd}{Changes the working directory.}

\item{verbose_mode}{Sets verbose mode. If verbose mode is \code{FALSE}, tools will not print output messages.}

\item{compress_rasters}{Sets the flag used by WhiteboxTools to determine whether to use compression for output rasters.}

\item{command_only}{Return command that would be executed by \code{system()} rather than running tool.}
}
\value{
Returns the tool text outputs.

\description{
Reads a LiDAR (LAS) point file and outputs a raster containing the number of overlapping flight lines in each grid cell.
