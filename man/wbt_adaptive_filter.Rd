  input,
  output,
  filterx = 11,
  filtery = 11,
  threshold = 2,

\arguments{
\item{input}{Input raster file.}

\item{output}{Output raster file.}

\item{filterx}{Size of the filter kernel in the x-direction.}

\item{filtery}{Size of the filter kernel in the y-direction.}

\item{threshold}{Difference from mean threshold, in standard deviations.}

\item{wd}{Changes the working directory.}

\item{verbose_mode}{Sets verbose mode. If verbose mode is \code{FALSE}, tools will not print output messages.}

\item{compress_rasters}{Sets the flag used by WhiteboxTools to determine whether to use compression for output rasters.}

\item{command_only}{Return command that would be executed by \code{system()} rather than running tool.}
}
\value{
Returns the tool text outputs.
