\title{whitebox: 'WhiteboxTools' R Frontend}
\description{
An R frontend for the 'WhiteboxTools' library, which is an advanced geospatial data analysis platform developed by Prof. John Lindsay at the University of Guelph's Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research Group. 'WhiteboxTools' can be used to perform common geographical information systems (GIS) analysis operations, such as cost-distance analysis, distance buffering, and raster reclassification. Remote sensing and image processing tasks include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic sharpening, contrast adjustments), image mosaicing, numerous filtering operations, simple classification (k-means), and common image transformations. 'WhiteboxTools' also contains advanced tooling for spatial hydrological analysis (e.g. flow-accumulation, watershed delineation, stream network analysis, sink removal), terrain analysis (e.g. common terrain indices such as slope, curvatures, wetness index, hillshading; hypsometric analysis; multi-scale topographic position analysis), and LiDAR data processing.

\section{Package options}{

\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{whitebox.exe_path}} - character. Path to executable file. The default value is the package installation directory, subdirectory \code{"WBT"}, followed by \code{whitebox_tools.exe} or \code{whitebox_tools}. Set the \code{whitebox.exe_path} option using \code{wbt_init()} \code{exe_path} argument
\item \strong{\code{whitebox.verbose}} - logical. Should standard output from calls to executable be \code{cat()} out for readability? Default is result of \code{interactive()}. Individual tools may have \code{verbose_mode} setting that produce only single-line output when \code{FALSE}. These argument values are left as the defaults defined in the package documentation for that function. When \code{whitebox.verbose=FALSE} no output is produced. Set the value of \code{whitebox.verbose} with \code{wbt_verbose()} \code{verbose} argument.
}

The package options can be overridden with system environment variables: \code{R_WHITEBOX_EXE_PATH} (character) and \code{R_WHITEBOX_VERBOSE}, respectively.
