**WhiteboxTools** R Frontend.

This repository is related to the **whitebox** R package for geospatial analysis, which is an R frontend of a stand-alone executable command-line program called **[WhiteboxTools](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools)**.

## Description

The **whitebox** R package is built on **WhiteboxTools**, an advanced geospatial data analysis platform developed by Prof. John Lindsay ([webpage](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html); [jblindsay](https://github.com/jblindsay)) at the University of Guelph's [Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research Group](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html). *WhiteboxTools* can be used to perform common geographical information systems (GIS) analysis operations, such as cost-distance analysis, distance buffering, and raster reclassification. Remote sensing and image processing tasks include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic sharpening, contrast adjustments), image mosaicing, numerous filtering operations, simple classification (k-means), and common image transformations. *WhiteboxTools* also contains advanced tooling for spatial hydrological analysis (e.g. flow-accumulation, watershed delineation, stream network analysis, sink removal), terrain analysis (e.g. common terrain indices such as slope, curvatures, wetness index, hillshading; hypsometric analysis; multi-scale topographic position analysis), and LiDAR data processing. LiDAR point clouds can be interrogated (LidarInfo, LidarHistogram), segmented, tiled and joined, analyzed for outliers, interpolated to rasters (DEMs, intensity images), and ground-points can be classified or filtered. *WhiteboxTools* is not a cartographic or spatial data visualization package; instead it is meant to serve as an analytical backend for other data visualization software, mainly GIS.

## Installation

There are three ways to install the **whitebox** R package.

### 1. CRAN

**whitebox** is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=whitebox), so you can install it with:

```R
install.packages("whitebox")
```

### 2. R-Forge

**whitebox** is also available on [R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=2337), so you can install it with:

```R
install.packages("whitebox", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
```

### 3. GitHub

You can alternatively install the development version of **whitebox** from [GitHub](https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR) as follows:

```R
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("giswqs/whiteboxR", build = FALSE)
```

## Usage

The function `wbt_init()` checks the path to the WhiteboxTools binary.

```r
wbt_init()
```
It (invisibly) returns a logical (TRUE/FALSE) value reflecting whether a file is found at one of the default paths, including those specified by package options. See `?whitebox::whitebox`.
 
If you have WhiteboxTools installed already but in a non-standard location run `wbt_init(exe_path=...)` to set up your options for your current R session.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wbt_init(exe_path = 'C:/home/user/path/to/whitebox_tools.exe')
```

Additional arguments to `wbt_init()` can set other package options, such as whether tools print their standard console output with `cat()`.

If you want to turn this off, set `verbose = FALSE`, for instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wbt_init(exe_path = 'C:/home/user/path/to/whitebox_tools.exe', verbose = FALSE)
```

## Documentation

For whitebox package documentation in R, ask for help:

```r
??whitebox
```

For list of functions, try the `wbt_` prefix in your search:

```r
??wbt_
```

A complete list of functions available in the **whitebox** R package can be found [HERE](https://giswqs.github.io/whiteboxR/reference/index.html). 

Check out this [demo](https://giswqs.github.io/whiteboxR/articles/demo.html) for examples.

## Installing WhiteboxTools 

The quickest way to get started if you are on 64-bit Windows, Linux or MacOS architectures is to download and install the WhiteboxTools binary. A method `install_whitebox()` is provided to download a version of the binaries that corresponds to the wrapper functions available in the package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
whitebox::install_whitebox()
```

By default this will install to your whitebox R package installation directory (e.g. in your R package library), subdirectory "WBT".

## whitebox

**How do I run tools?**

Tool names in the whitebox R package can be called by corresponding function using `wbt_snake_case()` naming convention (e.g. `wbt_lidar_info()` R function for `"LidarInfo"` WhiteboxTools tool name).

First we load the library and perform any necessary setup. 

```{R}
library(whitebox)

# set up as needed
wbt_init()
```

Many WhiteboxTools will take GeoTIFF files as input. There is a sample Digital Elevation Model (DEM) included in the whitebox package. You can get path as follows for this demo:

```{R}
# Set input raster DEM file
dem <- system.file("extdata", "DEM.tif", package = "whitebox")
```

We will use this DEM in and perform a sequence of processing routines.

 1. Applies feature-preserving smoothing (FeaturePreservingSmoothing)
 
 2. Breaches depressions in a DEM (BreachDepressions)
 
 3. Calculates D-Infinity flow accumulation (DInfFlowAccumulation)
 
Run tools passing file paths for input and output grids. 

In this case we will deal with GeoTIFF input, but WhiteboxTools supports several grid input formats.

The `filter` argument sets the size of the filter kernel.

```{r}
## 1. FeaturePreservingSmoothing
wbt_feature_preserving_smoothing(
  dem = dem,
  output = "./smoothed.tif",
  filter = 9
)

## 2. BreachDepressions
wbt_breach_depressions(dem = "./smoothed.tif", output = "./breached.tif")

## 3. DInfFlowAccumulation
wbt_d_inf_flow_accumulation(input = dem, output = "./flow_accum.tif")
```

```{r}
if (requireNamespace('raster')) {
  raster::plot(raster::raster("./flow_accum.tif"))
}
```

**About WhiteboxTools**

wbt_license()

# Prints the whitebox-tools version
wbt_version()

# Prints the toolbox for a specific tool.

## Available Tools

The **[WhiteboxTools](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools)** library currently contains more than **448** tools, which are each grouped based on their main function into one of the following categories: Data Tools, GIS Analysis, Hydrological Analysis, Image Analysis, LiDAR Analysis, Mathematical and Statistical Analysis, Stream Network Analysis, and Terrain Analysis. For a listing of available tools, complete with documentation and usage details, please see the [WhiteboxTools User Manual](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/index.html).
