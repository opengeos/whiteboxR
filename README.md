## Description

The **whitebox** R package is built on **WhiteboxTools**, an advanced
geospatial data analysis platform developed by Prof. John Lindsay
([webpage](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html);
[jblindsay](https://github.com/jblindsay)) at the University of Guelph’s
[Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research
Group](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html). _WhiteboxTools_ can
be used to perform common geographical information systems (GIS)
analysis operations, such as cost-distance analysis, distance buffering,
and raster reclassification. Remote sensing and image processing tasks
include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic sharpening, contrast
adjustments), image mosaicing, numerous filtering operations, simple
classification (k-means), and common image transformations.
_WhiteboxTools_ also contains advanced tooling for spatial hydrological
analysis (e.g. flow-accumulation, watershed delineation, stream network
analysis, sink removal), terrain analysis (e.g. common terrain indices
such as slope, curvatures, wetness index, hillshading; hypsometric
analysis; multi-scale topographic position analysis), and LiDAR data
processing. LiDAR point clouds can be interrogated (LidarInfo,
LidarHistogram), segmented, tiled and joined, analyzed for outliers,
interpolated to rasters (DEMs, intensity images), and ground-points can
be classified or filtered. _WhiteboxTools_ is not a cartographic or
spatial data visualization package; instead it is meant to serve as an
analytical backend for other data visualization software, mainly GIS.

## Installation

There are three ways to install the **whitebox** R package.

### 1. CRAN

**whitebox** is now available on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=whitebox), so you can install
it with:

    install.packages("whitebox")

### 2. GitHub

You can alternatively install the development version of **whitebox**
from [GitHub](https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR) as follows:

    if (!require("remotes")) install.packages('remotes')
    remotes::install_github("giswqs/whiteboxR", build = FALSE)

### 3. Docker

whiteboxR is also available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/giswqs/whiteboxr). Run the following command to start a Docker container with whiteboxR installed.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=mypassword -v ~/Documents:/home/rstudio/ giswqs/whiteboxr
```

Then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8787`. The default username is `rstudio` and the default password is `mypassword`.

## Usage

The function `wbt_init()` checks the path to the ‘WhiteboxTools’ binary.

    wbt_init()

It (invisibly) returns a logical (TRUE/FALSE) value reflecting whether a
file is found at one of the default paths, including those specified by
package options. See `?whitebox::whitebox`.

If you have ‘WhiteboxTools’ installed already but in a non-standard
location run `wbt_init(exe_path=...)` to set up your options for your
current R session.

    wbt_init(exe_path = 'C:/home/user/path/to/whitebox_tools.exe')

Additional arguments to `wbt_init()` can set other package options, such
as whether tools print their standard console output with `cat()`.

If you want to turn this off, set `verbose = FALSE`, for instance:

    wbt_init(exe_path = 'C:/home/user/path/to/whitebox_tools.exe', verbose = FALSE)

## Documentation

For whitebox package documentation in R, ask for help:

    ??whitebox

For list of functions, try the `wbt_` prefix in your search:

    ??wbt_

A complete list of functions available in the **whitebox** R package can
be found
[HERE](https://whietboxR.gishub.org/reference/index.html).

Check out this
[demo](https://whietboxR.gishub.org/articles/demo.html) for
examples.

## Installing ‘WhiteboxTools’

The quickest way to get started if you are on 64-bit Windows, Linux or
MacOS architectures is to download and install the ‘WhiteboxTools’
binary. Linux binaries compiled with ‘musl’ instead of ‘glibc’ on Ubuntu
22.04 are available with `platform="linux_musl"`. On MacOS, Intel and
Apple ‘M’ series processors (‘arm64’) are supported.

A method `install_whitebox()` is provided to download a version of the
binaries that corresponds to the wrapper functions available in the
package.

    whitebox::install_whitebox()

By default this will install ‘WhiteboxTools’ to your whitebox R package
data directory (see `wbt_data_dir()`), subdirectory “WBT”.

## whitebox

**How do I run tools?**

Tool names in the whitebox R package can be called by corresponding
function using `wbt_snake_case()` naming convention
(e.g. `wbt_lidar_info()` R function for `"LidarInfo"` ‘WhiteboxTools’
tool name).

First we load the library and perform any necessary setup.

    library(whitebox)

    # set up as needed
    wbt_init()

Many ‘WhiteboxTools’ will take GeoTIFF files as input, but
‘WhiteboxTools’ supports several grid input formats. There is a sample
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) included in the whitebox package. You can
get path as follows for this demo:

    # Set input raster DEM file
    dem <- sample_dem_data()

We will use this DEM in a sequence of ‘WhiteboxTools’ processing
routines. Run tools by passing file paths for the input and output
files.

1.  Apply feature-preserving smoothing (_FeaturePreservingSmoothing_)

2.  Breach depressions in a DEM (_BreachDepressions_)

3.  Calculate D-Infinity flow accumulation (_DInfFlowAccumulation_)

The `filter` argument to `wbt_feature_preserving_smoothing()` sets the
size of the filter kernel.

    ## 1. FeaturePreservingSmoothing
    wbt_feature_preserving_smoothing(
      dem = dem,
      output = "./smoothed.tif",
      filter = 9
    )

    ## 2. BreachDepressions
    wbt_breach_depressions(dem = "./smoothed.tif", output = "./breached.tif")

    ## 3. DInfFlowAccumulation
    wbt_d_inf_flow_accumulation(input = dem, output = "./flow_accum.tif")

    if (requireNamespace('terra')) {
      terra::plot(terra::rast("./flow_accum.tif"))
    }
    #> Loading required namespace: terra
