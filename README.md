## Description

The **whitebox** R package is built on **WhiteboxTools**, an advanced
geospatial data analysis platform developed by Prof. John Lindsay
([webpage](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html);
[jblindsay](https://github.com/jblindsay)) at the University of Guelph’s
[Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research
Group](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html). *WhiteboxTools* can
be used to perform common geographical information systems (GIS)
analysis operations, such as cost-distance analysis, distance buffering,
and raster reclassification. Remote sensing and image processing tasks
include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic sharpening, contrast
adjustments), image mosaicing, numerous filtering operations, simple
classification (k-means), and common image transformations.
*WhiteboxTools* also contains advanced tooling for spatial hydrological
analysis (e.g. flow-accumulation, watershed delineation, stream network
analysis, sink removal), terrain analysis (e.g. common terrain indices
such as slope, curvatures, wetness index, hillshading; hypsometric
analysis; multi-scale topographic position analysis), and LiDAR data
processing. LiDAR point clouds can be interrogated (LidarInfo,
LidarHistogram), segmented, tiled and joined, analyzed for outliers,
interpolated to rasters (DEMs, intensity images), and ground-points can
be classified or filtered. *WhiteboxTools* is not a cartographic or
spatial data visualization package; instead it is meant to serve as an
analytical backend for other data visualization software, mainly GIS.

## Installation

There are three ways to install the **whitebox** R package.

### 1. CRAN

**whitebox** is now available on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=whitebox), so you can install
it with:

    install.packages("whitebox")

### 2. R-Forge

**whitebox** is also available on
[R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=2337), so you can
install it with:

    install.packages("whitebox", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

### 3. GitHub

You can alternatively install the development version of **whitebox**
from [GitHub](https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR) as follows:

    if (!require("remotes")) install.packages('remotes')
    remotes::install_github("giswqs/whiteboxR", build = FALSE)

## Usage

The function `wbt_init()` checks the path to the WhiteboxTools binary.

    wbt_init()

It (invisibly) returns a logical (TRUE/FALSE) value reflecting whether a
file is found at one of the default paths, including those specified by
package options. See `?whitebox::whitebox`.

If you have WhiteboxTools installed already but in a non-standard
location run `wbt_init(exe_path=...)` to set up your options for your
current R session.

    wbt_init(exe_path = 'C:/home/user/path/to/whitebox_tools.exe')

Additional arguments to `wbt_init()` can set other package options, such
as whether tools print their standard console output with `cat()`.

If you want to turn this off, set `verbose = FALSE`, for instance:

    wbt_init(exe_path = 'C:/home/user/path/to/whitebox_tools.exe', verbose = FALSE)

## Documentation

For whitebox package documentation in R, ask for help:

    ??whitebox

For list of functions, try the `wbt_` prefix in your search:

    ??wbt_

A complete list of functions available in the **whitebox** R package can
be found
[HERE](https://giswqs.github.io/whiteboxR/reference/index.html).

Check out this
[demo](https://giswqs.github.io/whiteboxR/articles/demo.html) for
examples.

## Installing WhiteboxTools

The quickest way to get started if you are on 64-bit Windows, Linux or
MacOS architectures is to download and install the WhiteboxTools binary.
A method `install_whitebox()` is provided to download a version of the
binaries that corresponds to the wrapper functions available in the
package.

    whitebox::install_whitebox()

By default this will install to your whitebox R package installation
directory (e.g. in your R package library), subdirectory “WBT”.

## whitebox

**How do I run tools?**

Tool names in the whitebox R package can be called by corresponding
function using `wbt_snake_case()` naming convention
(e.g. `wbt_lidar_info()` R function for `"LidarInfo"` WhiteboxTools tool
name).

First we load the library and perform any necessary setup.

    library(whitebox)

    # set up as needed
    wbt_init()

Many WhiteboxTools will take GeoTIFF files as input. There is a sample
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) included in the whitebox package. You can
get path as follows for this demo:

    # Set input raster DEM file
    dem <- system.file("extdata", "DEM.tif", package = "whitebox")

We will use this DEM in and perform a sequence of processing routines.

1.  Applies feature-preserving smoothing (FeaturePreservingSmoothing)

2.  Breaches depressions in a DEM (BreachDepressions)

3.  Calculates D-Infinity flow accumulation (DInfFlowAccumulation)

Run tools passing file paths for input and output grids.

In this case we will deal with GeoTIFF input, but WhiteboxTools supports
several grid input formats.

The `filter` argument sets the size of the filter kernel.

    ## 1. FeaturePreservingSmoothing
    wbt_feature_preserving_smoothing(
      dem = dem,
      output = "./smoothed.tif",
      filter = 9
    )

    ## 2. BreachDepressions
    wbt_breach_depressions(dem = "./smoothed.tif", output = "./breached.tif")

    ## 3. DInfFlowAccumulation
    wbt_d_inf_flow_accumulation(input = dem, output = "./flow_accum.tif")

    if (requireNamespace('raster')) {
      raster::plot(raster::raster("./flow_accum.tif"))
    }
    #> Loading required namespace: raster
